<!-- 
    Document Object Model
    DOM : Another Built-In Object called the Document Object
    The document object represents or models the webpage, it is linked to the webpage
    The document has properties and methods

    Window object represents the browser, which means everything(ie. webpage) inside the browser is in the window object 

    We can have HTML elements inside JS 
    The DOM combines JS and HTML together and it gives JS control of the webpage

    The HTML element is converted into a JS Object when it is inside a JS
    innerHTML ~ gives the entire HTML inside the element , JS can replace anything with this property
    Every HTML element has a property .innerHTML 

    document.body - lets us get body and put it inside JS whilst 
    document.querySelector - lets us get any element from the page and put it inside JS
    using class in js, always start with js-xxx ~ class-selector : It allows us to target specifics 

    HTML are JS Objects and we can save Objects(values) as a variable

    Be careful of spaces , it affects innerHTML - we can use innerText instead

    Always turn repetitive and too many lines of code to a fn 
    
    For elements like input with no html inside , we use value

    Events are like click, keydown 
    Event listeners are like onclick, onkeydown 
    Every event listener gets an event object 

    If a string only contains a number and we -*/ >> It will be converted into a number 
    Always do maths using numbers and not strings

    We dont have to type "Window", JS will automatically add it . It is a built-in object that repr browser, JS automattically converts to window when we using document
