Git : track changes in our code and lets us easily undo our changes

Repository : a folder where changes are being tracked

## Main Idea of JS

1. Save the data
2. Generate the HTML
3. Make it interactive

data - information ; information about our products

We usually use a combination of object and arrays to create a DS

How do we know which product to add?
Data Attribute:

- is just another HTML attribute
- allows us to attach any information to an element
- name on the left , value on the right
- have to start with "data-" kebab case
- then give it any name

Modules : a better way to organize our code
